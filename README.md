# (OOP) PHP REST API

I recently undertook an exciting project to develop a PHP RESTful API that seamlessly connects to a database to retrieve blog posts.

Using my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, I designed and built a robust API that adheres to the REST architecture. I leveraged PHP's powerful features to create an intuitive and efficient system for reading blog posts. By adopting OOP principles, I was able to organize the codebase effectively, ensuring better maintainability and scalability of the API.

The core functionality of the API revolves around seamless communication with the database. I skillfully implemented methods to handle HTTP requests, such as GET, to fetch blog posts from the database. The API's response format adheres to the JSON standard, making it easily consumable by client-side applications.

In addition to the technical challenges, I also paid close attention to security aspects. I implemented proper data validation and utilized prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks, ensuring the API is robust and secure.

Throughout the development process, I rigorously tested the API using various scenarios and edge cases to ensure its reliability and stability. I also documented the code extensively, making it easier for other developers to understand and collaborate on the project.
